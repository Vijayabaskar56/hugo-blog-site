<h1>Day 3 of nights and weekends</h1>
<p>Hey, It&rsquo;s officially day 3 from the day I have started, and I haven&rsquo;t made much progress till now, but I am determined to stick to the end. I believe every single progress counts.</p>
<p>So here is today&rsquo;s progress: I created a mock scroll view of songs with dummy data, and I am also planning to use the Spotify Developer API to get the user&rsquo;s recently listened songs and display the songs on the Home Screen so that it can be easy to add their recent favorites to the room.</p>
<p>Like I have said, I haven&rsquo;t made any significant progress, but I started to get in the flow, and sure will try to finish the UI-related things before Monday. Friday is officially over, and I have two more days left for the UI part.</p>
<p>Also, I have learned a lesson from the previous day&rsquo;s mistake, which was I am trying to make it perfect from the start. I chose a UI Styling Kit that is so hard to understand just because some random YouTuber told that it was the best UI library for React Native. He might be right or wrong, but I should have first thought about if this really was what I wanted because mine is a hobby project, and I have only six weeks of deadline to finish the app. I spent literally one day configuring the setting up and understanding the library, and it was too much for me. I lately realized it was going to consume so much time if I continued using it, so I ditched that and went the old-school way with StyleSheet, which makes the process faster.</p>

<p>Okay, I told you that I would share my progress with screenshots, so here it is. I know it looks terrible, but I am just starting learning. I will make it look awesome.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s it for today. I will share the progress tomorrow.</p>
