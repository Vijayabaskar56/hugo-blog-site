                It&rsquo;s day two , and like I said yestarday I wanted to document my journey, so here I am,

                I am participating in the Nights and Weekends Season 5 of BuildSpace, so this blog is about:
What the heck is that? Why am I excited about it? What is the plan and other stuff. BuildSpace is a home for people bringing their wildest ideas to life, and every year they conduct an event named Nights and Weekends. The general idea behind the event is that anybody can join with an idea of their own and bring it to life over a six-week period.

                I am preparing for an interview and noticed that the job description mentions knowledge of OWASP is required. Since I didn&rsquo;t know what it was, I did what any reasonable person would do—I googled it. Googling only gives you a surface level of information, and for me, that’s never enough. I try to reach at least a 5/10 level of understanding when I learn any subject, and that’s when I feel satisfied.

                I recently bought a new laptop which comes with Windows preinstalled on it, but I am an avid Linux user. I love the flexibility and freedom that Linux provides, and I have my fair bit of experience with various Linux distros, from Ubuntu, Zorin, Kali to Arch.
So my first thought after getting my new laptop was to switch to Arch, but I wanted to give Windows a try before switching.

                Introduction Setting up my blog and configuring my domain introduced me to the fascinating world of the Domain Name System (DNS). As I delved deeper, I realized how crucial DNS is to the functioning of the internet, yet it often goes unnoticed. This post aims to demystify DNS from a beginner&rsquo;s perspective, sharing what I&rsquo;ve learned about this robust system that underpins the web.
“DNS is kind of the hamster under the hood that drives the Internet.
