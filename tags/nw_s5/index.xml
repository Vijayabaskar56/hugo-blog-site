      <description>I am participating in the Nights and Weekends Season 5 of BuildSpace, so this blog is about:&#xA;What the heck is that? Why am I excited about it? What is the plan and other stuff. BuildSpace is a home for people bringing their wildest ideas to life, and every year they conduct an event named Nights and Weekends. The general idea behind the event is that anybody can join with an idea of their own and bring it to life over a six-week period.</description>
